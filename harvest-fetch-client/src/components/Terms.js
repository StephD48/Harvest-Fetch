							<br /><br />
							At Harvest Fetch, we are committed to protecting the privacy and security of information you share with us.
							<br /><br />
							This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their ‘Personally Identifiable Information’ (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context.
							<br /><br />
							<br /><br />
							<p className="title">Information we collect </p>
							<br /><br />
							We will not collect any personal information about you except when specifically and knowingly provided by you. We collect information from you when you register on our site, subscribe to a newsletter, make a purchase, respond to a survey, fill out a form, or enter other information on our site.
							<br /><br />
							<br /><br />
							<p className="title">How we use information </p>
							<br /><br />
							We may use the information you provide in order to:
							<ul className="bullets">
								<li>Personalize your experience and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product offerings in which you are most interested.</li>
								<li>Improve our website in order to better serve you.</li>
								<li>Allow us to better service you in responding to your customer service requests.</li>
								<li>Administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature.</li>
								<li>Follow up after correspondence (email or phone inquiries).</li>
							</ul>
							<br /><br />
							<p className="title">How we protect information </p>
							<br /><br />
							Our website is scanned on a regular basis for security risks and known vulnerabilities in order to make your visit to our site as safe as possible.
							<br /><br />
							Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.
							<br /><br />
							We implement a variety of security measures when a user places an order, enters, submits, or accesses information to maintain the safety of personal information.
							<br /><br />
							All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers.
							<br /><br />
							<br /><br />
							<p className="title">How we use cookies </p>
							<br /><br />
							Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may also use trusted third-party services that track this information on our behalf.
							<br /><br />
							You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Since each browser is a little different, look at your browser’s Help Menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.
							<br /><br />
							If you turn cookies off, some features will be disabled. Some of the features that make your site experience more efficient and may not function properly, like automatic login.
							<br /><br />
							However, you will still be able to place orders over the telephone by contacting customer service.
							<br /><br />
							<br /><br />
							<p className="title">How we work with third-parties </p>
							<br /><br />
							We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information unless we provide users with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release information when it’s release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others’ rights, property or safety.
							<br /><br />
							<br /><br />
							<p className="title">Google &amp; Tracking </p>
							<br /><br />
							We use Google Analytics on our website.
							<br /><br />
							Users can visit our site anonymously. We also honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
							<br /><br />
							<br /><br />
							<p className="title">COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act) </p>
							<br /><br />
							We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old. If we become aware that we have collected personally identifiable information from someone under the age of thirteen, we will remove that child’s personal information from our database.
							<br /><br />
							<br /><br />
							<p className="title">Fair Information Practices </p>
							<br /><br />
							The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
							In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur we will notify you via email within 7 business days.
							<br /><br />
							We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
							<br /><br />
							<br /><br />
							<p className="title">Email communications </p>
							<br /><br />
							We comply with the CAN-SPAM Act, a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
							<br /><br />
							We collect your email address in order to:
							<ul className="bullets">
								<li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions</li>
								<li>Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.</li>
								<li>Send you additional information related to your product and/or service</li>
								<li>Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred.</li>
							</ul>
							<br />
							To be in accordance with CAN-SPAM, we agree to the following:
							<ul className="bullets">
								<li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>
								<li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li>
								<li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</li>
								<li>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li>
								<li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</li>
								<li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.</li>
							</ul>
							<br />
							If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at info@harvestfetch.com or follow the instructions at the bottom of each email and we will promptly remove you from all correspondence.
							<br /><br />
							<br /><br />
							<p className="title">Communication via SMS text </p>
							<br /><br />
